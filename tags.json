When you attempt to open this file, Windows sees that the file ends in a DOCX extension, which it already knows should be opened with the Microsoft Word program.\n\nFile extensions also often indicate the *file type*, or *file format*, of the file... but not always. Any file's extensions can be renamed but that won't convert the file to another format or change anything about the file other than this portion of its name.\n\nReference: http://pcsupport.about.com/od/termsf/g/file_extension.htm"
