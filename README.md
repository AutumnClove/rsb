Apex Discord Bot
=========


Please read the master branch's README before continuing.

Holy fuck was this bot a pain in the dick. I put 10ish hours into fucking with Discord's wonky ass backend trying to fight its latency.

This bot does some fancy fucking auto expanding channels that works for discords that expect to fill a category (50 max channels) with voice channels. Essentially creates an empty or filling category and when filled, moves it to a filled category.

Minimum movements and gfycat style names make it one of the best solutions for discords that want the flexibility of auto expanding channels and want their users to be able to find them.

Naming scheme is defined in `monsters.py` but its essentially `[REGION]` + `adjective` + `monster`.

PS: Fuck that discord for removing it after literally 2 days of use. I'm still pissed about that.
